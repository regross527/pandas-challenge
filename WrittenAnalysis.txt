1) Male players are our most common users, but they also tend to spend less, per person, than non-male players. Perhaps looking into ways to improve the game's appeal to non-male players would help increase profitability.

2) Our age demographics skew heavily towards players in their early 20s (20-24). Those players are some of the most profitable as well, so no need to make major changes there.

3) Some items (such as Nirvana and Singed Scalpel) are making high amounts of income despite their high prices. Perhaps a slight reduction to cost on these items would improve the likelihood that these items would be purchased more often, thus generating even greater revenue.
